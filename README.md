# Twitter2Notion_Music_Database

So a friend of mine did the review of an album once a day for a lot of days! I found that was really interesting but since he did on twitter, it was very hard to understand the best and worst scored albums, the images of the albums, etc...  So this is a project to scrape it from his account and transform it into a Notion database with images so he can have a very cool library with all that information :)
